# MedTracker
## Description

Web app to track and visualize the effects of medication prescriptions.

## Initial setup
On startup the project will create a folder in the users home directory H2DBs, H2 database files will be stored here.\
A webserver will be started on port 3100

## How to use
After starting the application, in a browser go to localhost:3100.\
A homepage with login and registration links will be presented.

Unauthorized users can register an account. New accounts have the Basic/Patient role by default.

Several types of user exist in the system.
- Basic/Patient
  - (unimplemented) Request registration with one or more practitioners
  - Bulk upload data from Excel files
  - View their prescriptions
  - Request a role upgrade to "Practitioner"
    - this request must be reviewed and approved by a user with the "Admin" role
  - View visualizations of their uploaded data, "Data Upload" page
- Practitioner
  - View a list of all "Patient" users
    - (unimplemented) filter by patients registered with the practitioner
  - (unimplemented) view patient data, including prescriptions from other practitioners
  - (unimplemented) prescribe medications to their registered patients
  - (unimplemented) add new medications to the system
  - (unimplemented) view all medications
- Admin
  - View all users 
  - Approved role upgrades
  - Downgrade roles

###### Uploads
Navigating to the "Upload" page will allow you to upload different types of .xlsx file.\

    src/main/resources/InitialDataFiles/doses.xlsx
    ```
- Blood Pressure
  - ``` 
    src/main/resources/InitialDataFiles/bloodPressureReadings.xlsx
    ```
###### Data Overview
Navigating to the "Data Overview" page will display some visualizations of the uploaded data

allowing the user to request a role upgrade again in the future.

## Developer notes
### Ongoing Development
The majority of currently unimplemented features mentioned in this document are supported by the current object model,
except patient registration with a practitioner.

### DB Filling
On startup of the application two sources of initial data may be loaded
- On an empty DB the data.sql file will fill some basic bootstrapping data
- If there are less than two medications in the DB (this rule is totally arbitrary), then extra data will be loaded from the files located
  - ``` 
      src/main/resources/InitialDataFiles
      ```
